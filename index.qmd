### Happiness across the world over time

The World Happiness Report is a well-known source of cross-country data on self-reported life satisfaction, collected by the Gallup World Poll. The visualizations below present the ‘happiness scores’ for each country, published these reports.

The main life evaluation question asked in the poll is the Cantril Life Ladder question:

> “Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?”

## 🔢 Table

**Average self-reported life satisfaction** – Cantril Ladder score (0=worst; 10=best)

```{r}
# In this tab, you will create a table similar to the one on the Our World in Data page. The table should have the following columns:
# Country, `2011`, `2023`, Absolute change, and Relative change.


# Create table

d <- cantril %>%  select(-Code) %>%  filter(Year %in% c(2011, 2023)) %>%   pivot_wider(names_from = Year,
                                                    values_from = "Cantril ladder score") %>%  mutate("Absolute change" = round(`2011` -`2023`, 2), "Relative change" = round(c(`2011` -`2023`)/`2011`*100, 1)) 

reactable(d)


```


## 🌎 Map

The map plots the average answer that survey respondents provided to this question in different countries. As with the steps of the ladder, values in the map range from 0 to 10.

```{r}
# This code is already done for you. You don't need to change anything here. If you change any of the column names, or something else with the data, you may need to adjust the code below.

# Make boundaries light grey
l <- list(color = toRGB("grey"), width = 0.5)

# Specify map projection/options
g <- list(
  showframe = FALSE,
  coastlinecolor = "grey", # Set coastline color
  coastlinewidth = 0.5, # Set coastline width
  projection = list(type = 'Mercator')
)

# Create choropleth map
cantril %>%
  mutate(`Cantril ladder score` = round(`Cantril ladder score`, 2)) %>%
  plot_geo(width = 940) %>%
  add_trace(
    z = ~`Cantril ladder score`,
    color = ~`Cantril ladder score`,
    zmin = 0, # Set minimum value for color scale
    zmax = 10, # Set maximum value for color scale
    locations = ~Code,
    text = ~Country,
    frame = ~Year, colors = "YlGn",
    marker = list(line = l)
  ) %>%
  colorbar(title = "Ladder Score",
           tickvals = seq(0, 10, by = 2),
           ticktext = seq(0, 10, by = 2)) %>%
  layout(geo = g)
```


## 📈 Simple Chart

```{r}
# In this tab, create a simple line chart of the Cantril score over time for a few countries, similar to the one on the Our World in Data page.
# Note that your chart will not have the ability to filter countries like the one on the Our World in Data page.

# Create line chart
dt <- cantril %>%  select(-Code) %>%  filter(Country %in% c("Benin", "Canada", "Brazil", "Chad")) 

graph <- ggplot(data = dt, aes(x = `Year`, y = `Cantril ladder score`, group=`Country`, color=`Country`)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,100)) +
  labs(x="Year", y="Cantril ladder score") +
  theme_minimal() 

  ggplotly(graph)
```

## 📈 Advanced Chart


One problem with the simple chart on the previous tab is that the countries are fixed. It would be better if the user could select the countries they want to see. This is not possible with `plotly` alone, but with the `crosstalk` package and some custom JavaScript, we can achieve this, as demonstrated below.

This is simply a demonstration for you, you do not need to work on this for your assignment. You may want to come back to this when you need such functionality in your own projects.

For more information on how we achieved this, see [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67058016/how-to-set-default-values-in-filter-select-in-crosstalk-in-r-plotly).


```{r}
pacman::p_load(crosstalk, plotly)

# Crosstalk shared data object
# This allows the filter to interact with the plot
shared_cantril_data <- highlight_key(cantril)

cantril_plotly <- plot_ly(
  shared_cantril_data, 
  x = ~Year, 
  y = ~`Cantril ladder score`, 
  color = ~Country, 
  type = "scatter", 
  mode = "lines+markers"
) %>%
  layout(yaxis = list(range = c(0, 10)))


country_filter <- filter_select(
  "country_filter", 
  "Select a country to examine", 
  shared_cantril_data, 
  ~Country, 
  multiple = TRUE
)

# Output the filter and the plot
bscols(
  list(country_filter, cantril_plotly)
)
```

<!-- Custom javascript to set default values in the filter: -->
<script>
function filter_default() {
  var default_countries = ["Norway", "Australia", "Germany", "Bolivia", "Colombia", "Bhutan"]; // Set default countries here
  document.getElementById("country_filter").getElementsByClassName("selectized")[0].selectize.setValue(default_countries, false);
}
window.onload = filter_default;
</script>
